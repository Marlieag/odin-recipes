        Cortadillo also known as Mexican Pink Cake, is one of my favorite childhood deserts. I 
        remember when I was little my mom would take me to the panaderia to buy pan dulce, and this pink cake 
        was always my top pick. It may be the hot pink frosting that caught my attention, but I promise the fluffy
        yellow cake melts in your mouth. Below is a recipe I got from <a href="chicanoeats.com">Chicano Eats</a> , 
        it's one that recreates the cake I had growing up. Enjoy!

        <strong>Instructions</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>For Cake</strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li> 
            Preheat your oven to 350 F and grease and line a 9x13" 
            baking pan with a parchment sling so the two longer sides have a piece 
            hanging over the pan to help with lifting later. 
        </li>
        <li> 
            In a medium sized bowl whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt 
            and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Beat the butter with the sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitter with the 
            paddle attachment on medium speed until light and fluffy. This should take about 
            2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li> 
            Add the vanilla and eggs, one at a time, making sure that ones mixed in
            before adding the next. After the eggs have been mixed in, add one third 
            the dry ingredients, mix on low to incorporate, then 1/3 of the buttermilk, 
            followed by another third of the dry mixture,another third of the buttermilk, 
            and finally the last amount of each. Mix just until combined then use a silicone
            spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add batter to the prepared pan, smooth
            it out. Bake for 24-30 minutes, until the cake is lightly golden brown and a 
            toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Let the cake cool completely then make the buttercream.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <strong>For the Buttercream</strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In the bowl of a stand up mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the 
            butter with the vanilla and salt for a full minute at medium speed. Turn the 
            speed down to low and add the powdered sugar 1/2 cup at a time.
        </li>
        <li>
            After you have all the powdered sugar mixed in, add the heavy cream and turn the 
            mixer on low to incorporate it then to medium high for a full minute to make the 
            buttercream nice and fluffy. 
        </li>
        <li>
            After the buttercream is ready you can add the food coloring. I ended up adding 40
            drops of neon pink food coloring to get the saturation correct, but start with 20 and 
            go from there. Mix the buttercream just until the color is all incorporated then spread
            it evenly over the cake and top with sprinkles. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the cake in the fridge for 30-45 minutes and wait until the frosting firms up for 
            a clean cut and even better tasting cake!
        </li>
    </ol>
