    <strong>Ingredients</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>½ white or yellow onion, roughly chopped</li>
    <li>1 jalapeno, seeded (or leave seeds in if you like it a little spicy like I do!)</li>
    <li>1 bunch fresh cilantro (reserve a few for topping the rice)</li>
    <li>1 small lime, juiced</li>
    <li>2 cups low-sodium chicken broth (or water also works!)</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 cup white basmati or jasmine rice</li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Instructions</strong>
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        First make the green sauce: In a large high powered blender or food processor, 
        add in garlic, onion, jalapeno, cilantro, fresh lime juice, chicken broth, cumin, 
        salt and freshly ground black pepper. Blend or process until completely smooth.
    </li>
    <li>
        Place a medium pot over medium high heat. Slowly pour in the green sauce and fold in 
        the rice, making sure it is evenly distributed in the pan. Once the sauce is simmering, 
        reduce heat to low, cover the skillet immediately and cook for 20minutes. After 20 minutes, 
        remove the pan from heat (keep the lid on -- DO NOT OPEN), and allow rice to steam for another 
        10 minutes, then fluff rice with a fork. Serve with your favorite meal and garnish with extra 
        cilantro and/or jalapeno slices for a kick of heat. Serves 4.
