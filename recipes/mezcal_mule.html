    <p>
        Here is another recipe that I love from <a href="chicanoeats.com">
        Chicano eats</a>. Now I am a big fan of Moscow Mules, traditionally these 
        drinks are made with vodka and lime, but in this recipe we will be using mezcal 
        instead of vodka. Now if you are not familiar with mezcal it is similar to tequila, 
        but only in the sense that they are both made from an agave plant. Fun fact: tequila 
        can only be made from one type of agave plant, the Blue Weber, on the other hand mezcal 
        from a variety of agave plants. The smoky flavor of mezcal goes well with the ingredients 
        below. I hope you enjoy this cocktail as much as I did.
