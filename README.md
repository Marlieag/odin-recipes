Project Recipes for The Odin Project

Hello! My name is Marlin.
I am a front end developer from Colorado, USA.

I am currently working on a HTML Recipe Project for the Odin Project's curriculum. This project will be focused on working with HTML. I have some previous experience working with HTML and I am hoping that I can apply those skills on this project.
